1.	Text-to-Speech and Speech Recognition:
  o	The pyttsx3 library is used to provide vocal responses.
  o	The speech_recognition library listens for the user’s voice and converts it to text using Google’s API.

2.	Tasks Management:
  o	The tasks are stored in a dictionary, with the date as the key and the tasks for that day as the value.
  o	The update_tasks function listens to the user’s task input and updates the tasks for the current date.
  o	If the user says "no changes to the schedule," the script will not update anything.
  o	The display_tasks function will display the tasks for the day if any are present.

3.	Daily Task Update:
  o	The script will ask the user daily whether they want to update their tasks for the day. If the user says "yes," it will listen for the 
    task input and update the tasks. If the user says "no," it will display the tasks for that day.

4.	User Interaction:
  o	The script constantly runs in a loop and listens for input to either update the tasks, display them, or exit the application.

Usage Example:
  •	The assistant will start by asking if you want to update your tasks for today. If you say "yes," it will listen to your input for tasks.
  •	You can say "no changes to the schedule" if there are no updates.
  •	You can ask the assistant to show your tasks for the day or exit the application by saying "exit."

Sample Interaction:
  1.	The assistant asks: "Would you like to update your tasks for today?"
  2.	You respond: "Yes."
  3.	The assistant asks: "What tasks do you have for today?"
  4.	You say: "Finish report and attend team meeting."

5.	The assistant confirms: "Your tasks for today are: Finish report and attend team meeting."
If no tasks need updating:
  •	The assistant asks: "Would you like to update your tasks for today?"
  •	You respond: "No."
  •	The assistant displays: "Here are your tasks for today: Finish report and attend team meeting."

Notes:
  •	This script is simple and intended for local use; a more complex system could be integrated with a calendar API (e.g., Google Calendar) 
    for syncing tasks and reminders.
  •	You may need to adjust microphone settings or handle errors more robustly depending on your environment.
